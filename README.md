# iChrome

Uses a NW.js webview tag to display a website inside one of the devices supported by devices.css.

# Features

- Make the device fit your monitor while keeping the number of pixels visible on the device the same.
- Supports all the devices listed here: https://devicescss.xyz/phones.html.
- Choose the background color behind the device.
- Fullscreen mode.
- Change appearance by modifying the css file files.
- Windows, Linux and Mac support, thanks to NW.js.

# Security

- According to NW.js the `<webview>` tag should be safe, but make up your own mind:

# Thank you

- NW.js
- Devices.css
- Jeppe Tuxen, who challenged me to create a MVP of this app in a day for a presentation.
